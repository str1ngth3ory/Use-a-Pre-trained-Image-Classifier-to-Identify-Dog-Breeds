# Use-a-Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
Project 1 from Udacity AI Progaming with Python Nanodegree Program

## Description
This code implements a pretrained image classifier to identify dog breeds on a dataset of dog images.  
Classification result is generated as a text file.

## Requirement
Normal CPU should be sufficient. Speed varies based on size of dataset and the CNN architecture specified.

## Instruction
Run script in command with arguments as shown:
```
>>> python check_images.py --dir uploaded_images/ --arch resnet  
                           --dogfile dognames.txt > resnet_uploaded-images.txt
```
